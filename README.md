# Task1234
Another attempt at What Is Scripting 020822

I tried several different things to get this to work including renaming the file, ensuring it was a .sh file, and restarting completely. Still not discouraged but still not getting it to work. 

I tried:
chmod +x Task1234
chmod +x Task1234.sh
./Task1234.sh
./ Task1234.sh
chmod 711 ./Task1234.sh
chmod +x Task1234.sh
chmod +x ./ Task1234.sh
chmod 777 Task1234.sh
chmod 777 ./Task1234.sh
ls -l Task1234t.sh  (There is a typo here so I try it again once I notice it)
ls -l ./Task1234t.sh  (There is a typo here so I try it again once I notice it)
chmod u+x Task1234t.sh  (There is a typo here so I try it again once I notice it) 
ls -l ./Task1234.sh  
ls -l Task1234.sh  
chmod u+x Task1234.sh   
sudo chmod +x Task1234.sh   I GOT PERMISSION BUT IT STILL SAYS NO SUCH FILE OR DIRECTORY GOOD GRIEF
